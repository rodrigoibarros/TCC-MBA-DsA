<h1 align="center">Detection of Islanding Events in a Distribution System with Distributed Generation Using an ANN</h1>
My TCC project for the MBA in Data Analysis and Analytics from USP ESALQ.

This reposity contains a Data Base in a .xlsx file. These data refer to the average, standard deviation, max and min values of voltage (phases A, B and C), frequency
and rate of change of frequency for inumerous simulations of islanding events and faults using ATP.

MAIN.py is a script to create, train and test an ANN model
